# HopfieldNet
Hopfield Neural Network implementation in Python

For Kelley, Cyrus, and Ki:

- Hopfield2.py contains the actual Hopfield network and STDP code, but...
- Tests.py is where you'll actually run tests.

Everything is commented, and I think it should be fairly straightforward. 
If you need help, please let me know.
